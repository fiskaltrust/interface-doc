# fiskaltrust interface documentation
_Welcome to the open-source documentation of the fiskaltrust interface!_

This repository aims to provide a detailed technical specification of the fiskaltrust data interface used by POS-Systems to interact with the fiskaltrust.Middleware, so that PosCreators can integrate the fiskaltrust.Middleware into their systems without further support in most cases.

The technical specification of the data interface described in this document provides information regarding the following areas:
1. Access to the fiskaltrust.Middleware
2. Integration into the receipt based cash register workflow
3. The data structure
4. Function structure of the interface
5. Types of communication with fiskaltrust.Middleware
6. Operating categories
Interface specification is provided by fiskaltrust.Interface NuGet package, which can be found at https://www.nuget.org/packages/fiskaltrust.interface

Official PDF documents that are built from the source in this repository can be found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/interface-doc/releases).
