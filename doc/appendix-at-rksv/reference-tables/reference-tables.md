## Reference Tables

This chapter expands on the reference tables covered in Chapter <!-- TODO: Chapter reference --> 6.10 of the General Part on page 5 <!-- TODO: page references -->0, with country specific information applicable to the Austrian market.

### Service Status: ftState

The table <!-- TODO: table references --> below describes supported statuses for the ftState field in accordance with the Austrian law. These codes can be added through the logic operator "OR".

The country specific code, is made of the country’s code value following the ISO-3166-1-ALPHA-2 standard, converted from ASCII into hex. For Austria (AT) this is `0x4154`, which results in `0x4154000000000000` as the value for the "ready" status.

| `0x4154000000000001` | "out of service"<br />No RKSV signatures are generated or sent back. No RKSV-DEP is written, as nothing is being signed. The E131-DEP records requests and responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000002` | "SSCD temporary out of service"<br />For at least one receipt, it was not possible to receive the signature from an allocated SSCD. Thus, the security mechanism has been put into "signature creation device out of service" mode. Regardless of whether an allocated SSCD is available again or not, the mode remains in place until, via zero receipt, all previous receipts can be signed. If this mode is activated, an out of service signature, in accordance with the RKSV, is generated and sent back. | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000004` | "SSCD permanently out of service"<br />The status "SSCD temporary out of service" was activated more than 48h ago. Thus a FinanzOnline notification has been generated.<br />For conduct and termination of this mode, see "SSCD temporary out of service".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000008` | "subsequent entry activated"<br />At least one receipt has been transferred with a subsequent entry flag. In order to finalize the subsequent entry and leave the mode, it is necessary to generate a zero receipt. This zero receipt signs and secures the preliminary receipts accordingly to the RKSV.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000010` | "monthly report due"<br />If the latest monthly or annual report are not in the current month, the service will signal this. This status does not impact the signature conduct of the service, it is merely an indicative notification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 1.0                 |

| `0x0000000000010000` | "out of service"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which has been created during an outage of the security mechanism. The original receipts are available in handwritten or digital format and must now be transferred and subsequently consolidated and signed via zero receipt. In order to decide whether it is a temporary or permanent (more than 48 hours) outage of the security mechanism (for example in case of theft), the "oldest" or the receipt with the earliest date/time value of all retrieved receipts is used. This can be necessary for example after a power or server outage.                                                                     | 0-              |
| `0x0000000000020000` | "training receipt"<br />Requests with this type of receipt are annotated with the reference "TRA" in the signature block. Instead of the encrypted cumulative sales counter, the BASE64 encrypted value of the TRA string is entered. The sales counter is, in accordance with the RKSV, not adjusted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 0-              |
| `0x0000000000040000` | "reverse receipt"<br />Requests with this type of receipt are annotated with the reference "STO" in the signature block. Instead of the encrypted cumulative sales counter, a BASE64 encrypted value of the STO string is entered. Further processing depends on the underlying type of receipt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 0-              |
| `0x0000000000080000` | "handwritten receipt" or "subsequent entry"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which has been collected in a handwritten receipt. Although there is no requirement for a time annotation on a handwritten receipt we recommend using 12:00 for this purpose.<br />Further processing depends on the underlying type of receipt. For example, this can conduct after §7 cash revenue law for sales that were made outside business premises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 0-              |

A special note "sales tax relief in accordance with §6 Abs 1 Z 27" is possible. The RKSV requirement is handled according to the basic business transaction.<br />The transferred receipt data should contain the correct VAT rate and the correct ftChargeItemCase, even if the identified sales tax is 0%.                                                                                                                                                                                   | 0-              |

From €400 onwards, there are additional features to be displayed on the invoice, in order to enable the pre-tax deduction for the receiver of the invoice.<br />For receipts with a gross amount of €10.000 or more, in addition the service receiver’s UID number has to be indicated.<br />We suggest to transfer the data about the receiver in the field ftReceiptCaseData, in manufacturer-specific JSON format. | 0-              |

### Printing of QR-Code not supported

In the case that no QR code can be issued, it is allowed to place text using OCR typeface onto the receipt. For this procedure, BASE64-coded data fields are displayed in BASE32 according to §11 para. 2 RKSV. The reason for this is that the capital "i" and lowercase "L" are not distinguishable from each other in many typefaces.

For example, the following signature value is converted in the way described above. Whereby the following output BASE64 (bold) is:

```
_R1-AT0_DEMO-CASH-BOX426_776730_2015-10-14T18:20:23_0,00_0,00_0,00_0,00_0,00_0gJTFI8/zqc=_968935007593160625_fP7/PMP-SnQ0=_Xh5wNe0akaTOVvMgLVrCcRh2xmIyP91ogbxc5xv4Rrw64lpQsqLm+1GZxuCz4D1sZl9WCv3wMMoE0p+gyLaufg==
```
