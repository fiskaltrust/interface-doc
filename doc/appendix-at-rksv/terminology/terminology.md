| Cash register (RegK)                    | A cash register system (as well as classic cash register) combined with a fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism is a POS system in terms of RKSV. It may be associated with an additional input station. For simplicity in the following text we do not distinguish between the cash register itself and input stations - this difference is important only for the calculation of the state grant for each cash register.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
