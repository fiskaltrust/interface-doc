# fiskaltrust.Middleware für Windows

The fiskaltrust.Middleware runs as a service on all 32-bit and 64-bit platforms starting from Windows 7. Older operating systems are not supported as they do not meet the legal requirements of a "safe system environment".

## Windows versions support and prerequisites

All supported operating system need C++ Runtime in 32 or 64 bit installed. We recommend to use .NET Framework 4.8 if possible.

Please be aware that dependent on the TSE used there may be additional requirements on protecting the OS environment as documented in the [on-premise-installation overview](..\on-premise-installation.md).
