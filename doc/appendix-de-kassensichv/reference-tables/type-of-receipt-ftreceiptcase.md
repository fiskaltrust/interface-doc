### Type of Receipt: ftReceiptCase

The `ftReceiptCase` indicates the receipt type and defines how it should be processed by the fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism in accordance with the German law.

For Germany (DE) the country code is `0x4445`. Thus, the value of an unknown `ftReceiptCase` in Germany is `0x4445000000000000`.

| **Value** | **Description** | **BON_TYP (DSFinV-K)** <br /> **processType (TSE)** | **Middleware- Version** |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x4445000000000000` | **unknown type for country-code "DE"**<br /><br />This receipt case is handled like a "pos-receipt" (`0x4445000000000001`). See below: | Beleg <br /> Kassenbeleg-V1 | 1.3- |
| `0x4445000000000001` | **pos-receipt**<br /><br />Represents the main kind of receipt processed by a POS system. Creates a turnover and/or change in the amount of cash in the till or similar operations. <br /><br />Use the `ftChargeItems` and `ftPayItems` to hand over details for processing. The `ftChargeItems` and `ftPayItems` should contain the full final state of the receipt. Turnover and cash amount is increased by the final pos-receipt content, intermediate start-transaction, update-transaction and delta-transaction content doesn't influence turnover and cash amount. The pos-receipt case can be used with **implicit and explicit** flow. <br /><br />The duration of the represented action is calculated using the minimum (start time) and maximum (end time) of datetimes over `ftReceiptRequest`/`ftChargeItems`/`ftPayItems` <br /><br />The BON_TYP (Beleg) of DSFinV-K can be overwritten by an `ftReceiptCaseFlag`.  | Beleg <br /> Kassenbeleg-V1 | 1.3- |
| `0x4445000000000002` | **zero-receipt**<br /><br />Used for communication test and functional test of the fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism. In addition, the response also contains a detailed status information about the used TSE-Device. TSE data is herefore loaded and that may cause a long running request. <br /><br />The request is only valid when the charge items block (`ftChargeItems`) and the pay items block (`ftPayItems`) in the `ftReceiptRequest` are empty arrays. <br /><br />This receipt case works **only** with **implicit** flow. Using it without the `ftReceiptCaseFlag` `0x0000000100000000` ends up in an exception.<br /><br />If you want to end an ongoing transaction without turnover (e.g. all items on a receipt are voided) then please use a regular `ftReceiptCase`.<br /><br /> Informations returned in the response are:<ul><li>List of `cbReceiptReferece <-> Transaction-ID` relations.</li><li>Statusdata of TSE, serialnumber, available/free memory, available number of signatures left, ...</li></ul>| [none] <br /> SonstigerVorgang  | 1.3- |
| `0x4445000000000003` | **initial operation receipt / start-receipt**<br /><br />The request is only valid with the same property requirements as a zero-receipt. It initializes a new fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism including also the initialization of the used TSE in the background. Depending on the TSE-Type used, this includes different actions.<br /><br />On successful initialization, a notification is created which includes the queue-id, scu-id, certificate/public-key, tse-serialnumber=hash(public-key). This notification needs to be reported to the tax administration.<br /><br />The request is only valid when the charge items block (`ftChargeItems`) and the pay items block (`ftPayItems`) in the `ftReceiptRequest` are empty arrays. <br /><br />This receipt case works **only** with **implicit flow**. calling without the `ftReceiptCaseFlag` `0x0000000100000000` ends up in an exception.| [none] <br /> SonstigerVorgang | 1.3- |
| `0x4445000000000004` | **out of operation receipt / stop-receipt**<br /><br />The request is only valid with the same property requirements as a zero-receipt. It is disabling the fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism including the deactivation of the client ID used in the TSE for the current queue. Optionally one can also deactivate the complete TSE used in background. This option will be available by a using a special flag soon.<br /><br />On successful deactivation, a notification is created which includes the queue-id, scu-id, certificate/public-key, tse-serialnumber=hash(public-key). this notification needs to be reported to tax administration. <br /><br />The request is only valid when the charge items block (`ftChargeItems`) and the pay items block (`ftPayItems`) in the `ftReceiptRequest` are empty arrays.<br /><br />This receipt case works **only** with **implicit flow**. Calling without the `ftReceiptCaseFlag` `0x0000000100000000` ends up in an exception. | AVSonstige <br /> SonstigerVorgang | 1.3- |
| `0x4445000000000005` | **monthly-closing**<br /><br />TBD: close all open cbReceiptReference <-> Transaction-ID  <br /> <br />This receipt case works **only** with **implicit flow**. Calling without the `ftReceiptCaseFlag` `0x0000000100000000` ends up in an exception. This is a zero-receipt. It is recommended to send this receipt at the end of each month to define the time of the accounting closure. | [none] <br /> SonstigerVorgang | 1.3- |
| `0x4445000000000006` | **yearly-closing**<br /><br />TBD: close all open cbReceiptReference <-> Transaction-ID  <br /> <br />This receipt case works **only** with **implicit flow**. Calling without the `ftReceiptCaseFlag` `0x0000000100000000` ends up in an exception. | [none] <br /> SonstigerVorgang | 1.3- |
| `0x4445000000000007` | **daily-closing**<br /><br />TBD: close all open cbReceiptReference <-> Transaction-ID  <br /> <br />This receipt case works **only** with **implicit flow**. Calling without the `ftReceiptCaseFlag` `0x0000000100000000` ends up in an exception. This is a zero-receipt. It is required to send this receipt at the end of each day to define the time of the accounting closure. | [none] <br /> SonstigerVorgang | 1.3- |
| `0x4445000000000008` | **start-transaction-receipt**<br /><br />Starts a new, unfinished action. Use `ftChargeItems` and `ftPayItems` to hand over already known details for final receipt. Using the same `cbReceiptReferece` in further calls connects the action items. <br /> <br />This receipt case works **only** with **explicit flow**. Calling with the `ftReceiptCaseFlag` `0x0000000100000000` ends up in an exception. | [none] <br /> [empty] | 1.3- |
| `0x4445000000000009` | **update-transaction-receipt**<br /><br />Updates an ongoing action. Use `ftChargeItems` and `ftPayItems` to hand over all details for the final receipt. Using the same `cbReceiptReferece` in further calls connects the action items. <br /><br />This receipt case works **only** with **explicit flow**. Calling with the `ftReceiptCaseFlag` `0x0000000100000000` ends up in an exception. | [none] <br /> [empty] | 1.3- |
| `0x444500000000000A` | **delta-transaction-receipt**<br /><br />Updates an ongoing action. Use `ftChargeItems` and `ftPayItems` to hand over changes for the final receipt. Using the same `cbReceiptReferece`  in further calls connects the action items. <br /><br />This receipt case works **only** on **explicit flow**. Calling with the `ftReceiptCaseFlag` `0x0000000100000000` ends up in an exception. | [none] <br /> [empty] | 1.3- |
| `0x444500000000000B` | **fail-transaction-receipt**<br /><br />Fails an ongoing transaction. It tries to finish either one or multiple open transaction (accepts fail, continue on fail) and clears the `cbReceiptReferece <-> Transaction-ID` relations. <br /><br /> To close **single open transactions**, an **explicit** fail-transaction receipt needs to be used. The open transaction needs to be referenced via `cbReceiptReference`. In case this value is not provided or no open transaction exists, the Middleware will throw an exception and the call will fail. <br /><br />  To close **multiple open transactions**, an **implicit** fail-transaction receipt needs to be sent. This can also be used to close transactions that were not opened by the Middleware (e.g. manually during testing). The transaction numbers that should be closed need to be passed via JSON in `ftReceiptCaseData`, using the array property `CurrentStartedTransactionNumbers` (e.g.: `ftReceiptCaseData: "{\"CurrentStartedTransactionNumbers\": [1, 2, 3]}"`). `cbReceiptReference` must be empty in this case, the Middleware will throw an exception and return an error otherwise. | AVBelegabbruch <br /> Kassenbeleg-V1 | 1.3- |

#### ftReceiptCaseFlag

This table expands on the values provided in table [ftReceiptCaseFlag in General Part](../../general/reference-tables/reference-tables.md#ftreceiptcaseflag) with values applicable to the German market.

| Value | Description | Middleware-Version |
|---|---|---|
| 0x0000000000010000  | failed receipt. Common behavior, see [general part](../../general/reference-tables/reference-tables.md#ftreceiptcaseflag).| 1.3- |
| 0x0000000000020000  | training receipt<br /> DSFinV-K: overrides BON_TYP=AVTraining  | 1.3- |
| 0x0000000000040000  | reverse/voided receipt<br /> DSFinV-K: overrides BON_TYP=AVBelegstorno | 1.3- |
| 0x0000000000080000  | paper/handwritten receipt | 1.3- |
| 0x0000000000100000  | small business, not taxable sales. TBD: law reference | 1.3- |
| 0x0000000000200000  | receiver is a company | 1.3- |
| 0x0000000000400000  | contains characteristics related to UStG. TBD: law reference | 1.3- |
| 0x0000000000800000  | Request additional informations from used TSE device. This is valid for Zero-Receipts only and responses a `TseInfo` entry in `ftStateData` field. Content of this item is same as declared in the IDESSCD interface described at [github.com/fiskaltrust](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware-interface-dotnet/blob/master/src/fiskaltrust.ifPOS/v1/de/Models/TseInfo.cs)  | 1.3.1 |
| 0x0000000001000000  | Request `ExecuteSelftest` and `ExecuteTimeUpdate` of used TSE device. This is valid for Zero-Receipts only and initiates a selftest and timeupdate at the used TSE device. Some devices (e.g. Swissbit) do require a selftest on a special period (e.g. 25h for Swissbit). On some devices this selftest is timeconsuming (e.g. up to 2 minutes on Swissbit) and therefore a pos-system can trigger this off peak serivcehours, to not block on receipt generation. <br /> If this is not used by pos-system the fiskaltrust-middleware cares on execution of selftest and timeupdate.  | 1.3.1 |
| 0x0000000001000000  | Request `clientId` registration only. This is valid for Initial-Operations-Receipt only. If an Initial-Operations-Receipt is executed with this flag set, no lifecycle-check is done for the connected TSE-device and also no initialization is triggerd. This requires a proper initialized TSE-device and then the current cbCashBoxIdentification of the Queue is registerd as a `cliendId` at the TSE-device.  | 1.3.1 |
| 0x0000000001000000  | Request `clientId` de-registration only. This is valid for Out-of-Operations-Receipt only. If an Out-of-Operations-Receipt is executed with this flag set, no lifecycle-change done for the connected TSE-device and also no diabling of the secure element is triggerd. This leaves back a TSE-device in initialized lifecycle and the current cbCashBoxIdentification of the Queue is de-registerd as a `cliendId` at the TSE-device. De-registration only is not supported by all TSE-devices. <br /> The normal behaviour of the Out-of-Operations-Receipt to disable the Queue is not influenced by this flag, what mean the Queue will not be useable anymore after execution of a Out-of-Operations-Receipt, the TSE-device can be used with a different Queue for further operations. | 1.3.1 |
| 0x0000000002000000  | Request download of TSE device .Tar-File. This is valid for Zero-Receipts only and processes a data-download from TSE device and this also leads to a data-upload to fiskaltrust-cloud. In case of an audit this can be used to get latest .Tar-File data available for download by using fiskaltrust-portal. .Tar-File download from TSE device is time consuming an may take more than 10 minutes to complete. <br /> If this is not used by pos-system the fiskaltrust-middleware cares on .Tar-File download after execution of daily-closing, monthly-closing, and yearly-closing. | 1.3.8 |
| 0x0000000004000000  | Request to bypass/avoid the download of TSE device .Tar-File. This is valid for daily-, montly-, and yearly-closing only. After the operations described before, a download of TSE device .Tar-File is done. This can be time consuming and also requires to not run any other operations on TSE device to be successfull. If this should **not** be executed, this flag can be used to bypass execution and keep TSE device useable for imediate receipt signing requests.  | 1.3.8 |
| 0x0000000008000000  | Request to update masterdata. This is valid for daily-, montly-, and yearly-closing only. Change of master-data already prepared in fiskaltrust-portal after rebuild of configuration and polled by fiskaltrust-middleware will be included in the moment of successfull execution of daily-, montly-, and yearly-closing. <br /> Master data are leaded by fiskaltrust-portal, manual change and update can be executed by UI, automated change and update will be possible by api (description will be provided later). <br /> This `ftReceiptCaseFlag` give a local point-of-sale-terminal the power do execute peviouse prepared master-data change. A default implementation could be to execute this on each daily-closing to get changes as soon done as they are reflacted to cashbox/queue.  | 1.3.4 |
| 0x0000000010000000  | Request to fail an raise exception on daily-closing with started transactions.  | 1.3.1 |
| 0x0000000100000000  | Implicit Transaction. No Start-Transaction call to ´Sign´ is required, it is done implicitly. If the unique identifier set in property ´cbReceiptReference´ already started a transaction, this will throw an exception. | 1.3.0  |
| 0x0000800000000000  | receipt request. Common behavior, see [general part](../../general/reference-tables/reference-tables.md#ftreceiptcaseflag).| 1.3- |
