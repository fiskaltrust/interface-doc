# Digital receipt bundles 

fiskaltrust offers four different bundle types, where digital receipt services are included, tailored to enable different use-cases, depending on the user need and the operational environment of the POS system.

In the basic and in the carefree bundle, a digital receipt can be provided via an existing integration of the fiskaltrust.Middleware. For more advanced concepts such as "Give-Away / QR-Label", additional meta data is required, which can be transferred to the Middleware via the existing function and data structure.

The prerequisite for use as a PosOperator is an activate user contract and the correspondingly required master data. The master data (including customization data like the company's logo) must be maintained in the outlet (i.e. the location) where the respective Queue (= POS system instance) is created. The master data must contain the necessary minimum information required for receipts.

1. Basic 
2. Carefree 
3. Give-Away / QR-Label
4. Pos Archive
