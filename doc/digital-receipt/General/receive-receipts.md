# Receive receipts 

There are various ways receipts are provided and transported towards the consumer. When a merchant uses digital receipts, it is important to teach the staff on how to use the system and to provide information on the availability of the different methods used. Not all available methods should be implemented, only the most efficient way related to the business should be used. 

## With customer facing display/device 

This sequence diagram describes the process of generating a digital receipt with a customer display, handheld or self-checkout device using the fiskaltrust digital receipt solution. The participants in the process are the merchant, fiskaltrust and the consumer. 

In store, the merchant collects the items and processes the checkout. Then the merchant sends a sign message to fiskaltrust for fiscalization purposes. The merchant then shows a QR-Code on a customer-facing display/device, which can be scanned by the consumer using their mobile phone. 

The consumer accesses the receipt by scanning the QR-Code displayed on the customer-facing display/device with their mobile phone. The consumer requests the receipt from fiskaltrust and receives an HTML document as the receipt. The consumer can then provide feedback regarding the receipt. 

Overall, this diagram illustrates the process of generating a digital receipt with customer display, handheld or self-checkout devices, where the receipt is accessed by the consumer through a QR-Code displayed on the customer-facing display/device.
