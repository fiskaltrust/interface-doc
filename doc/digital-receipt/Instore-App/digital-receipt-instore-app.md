# InStore App

:::info summary

After reading this, you understand the concept of the InStore App and configure an own InStore App installation.

:::

## Introduction

The fiskaltrust instore app can be used on a touch-enabled device with an integrated thermal printer. The fiskaltrust InStore App can listen to receipt issuing of multiple CashBoxes filtered by provided terminal-identification by each CashBox. Each time a related CashBox issues a receipt, the fiskaltrust InStore App pops up on the consumer facing touch screen and shows the following elements: 

* Number, moment of creation and total amount of the receipt 
* QR-Code with the https-receipt-link to hand over receipt to the consumer 
* Accept button to manually acknowledge received receipt 
* Print button with a countdown to print receipt

When the QR-Code is scanned and the https-receipt-link is used to download the https-receipt-document, then in the background there is an acknowledgement logged for receiving the receipt by the consumer and the current receipt display is closed. 

When the accept button is pressed by the consumer, then a manual acknowledgement for receiving the receipt is logged and the current receipt display is closed. 

When the print button is pressed by the consumer, or when the timeout/countdown is exceeded, then a paper receipt is printed and printing is logged for analytics. The current receipt display is closed after successful printing.

Setting up the InStore App requires no implementation into the Point of Sale software. The configuration process, encompassing POS-API Helper configuration and the steps for pairing the CashBox with the device, can be effortlessly completed within the fiskaltrust.Portal.

Since all operations within the app (Including QR-Code scanning, accepting and printing) are meticulously logged in the fiskaltrust.Portal, the InStore App attains complete compliance with Austria's "Belegausgabepflicht" and "Belegannahmepflicht", as well as Germany's "Belegausgabepflicht". Furthermore, the app ensures that the receipt will always be issued to the consumer. fiskaltrust appointed Markus Knasmüller from BMD to create an external assessment about the conformity of the digital receipt in Austria. The final assessment can be requested here: https://forms.office.com/e/0PcMDYWC2B
