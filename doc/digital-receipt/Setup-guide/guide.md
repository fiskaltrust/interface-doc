    Bluetooth to connect to the printer. You can check the Bluetooth settings in your
    device’s settings menu.

**Q: How can I reconnect the app to my Cashbox?**

- **A:** If the connection between the app and the Cashbox is lost, simply open the
    Fiskaltrust Portal again, copy the **PAIR CODE** , and re-enter it in the app. This will
    re-establish the connection.

**Q: The app isn't opening after installation. What do I do?**

- **A:** Make sure that your device has sufficient storage and that all necessary
    permissions (e.g., storage access, Bluetooth access) are granted. Try restarting
    your device and reinstalling the app if necessary.

**Q: I received an error message when pairing. What does it mean?**

- **A:** This could indicate an issue with the PAIR CODE. Please double-check the
    PAIR CODE you entered to ensure it is correct. You can also try copying and
    pasting the code again from the Fiskaltrust Portal.

    version is available.
