## Overview
fiskaltrust offers functionalities for providing different types of digital receipts via the fiskaltrust.Middleware.

We offer four different types of digital receipt, tailored to enable different use-cases, depending on the user need and the operational environment of the POS system.

1. Basic
2. Give-away
3. Promotion
4. Carefree

In the basic and in the carefree variant, a digital receipt can be provided via an existing integration of the fiskaltrust.Middleware without any additional implementation effort or change. For more advanced concepts such as "Give-Away" and "Promotion", additional meta data is required, which can be transferred to the Middleware via the existing function and data structure (see examples below).

The prerequisite for use as a PosOperator is an activate user contract and the correspondingly required master data. The master data (including customization data like the company's logo) must be maintained in the _outlet_ (i.e. the location) where the respective _Queue_ (= POS system instance) is created. The master data must contain the necessary minimum information required for receipts.

:::note

For POS systems without the fiskaltrust.Middleware, an own API is planned, but this is not available at the moment.

:::

## Basic version of the digital receipt
The basic version is free of charge and provides the digital receipt via a link that should be distributed as a QR code (e.g. on the customer display of the POS system), which should contain a URL in the following format: 
```
https://receipts.fiskaltrust.cloud/v0/[QueueId]/[QueueItemId]
```

This code (and the respective link) can be generated individually from any POS system, based on the data returned by the `/Sign` method of the fiskaltrust.Middleware (which is used to fiscalize receipts).

The advantage of this basic version is that it can be used without any further implementation efforts in the POS software. On the other hand, this approach can only be used with POS systems that have a customer display, and lacks other advantages of the options described below.

### Process flow
- The POS software calls the Middleware's `/Sign` function with a regular receipt request, and the request is processed by the Middleware.
- The POS software receives the the receipt response from the fiskaltrust.Middleware (which also contains the data for creating a printed receipt).
- The POS software extracts the `ftQueueId` and `ftQueueItemId` properties from the response, and generates the link from this data.
- The POS system displays a QR code that contains this link on the customer display.
- The customer or consumer scans the QR code via their smartphone, opens the link, and is displayed the digital receipt.
  
## Give-away version of the digital receipt
From the fiskaltrust.Portal, prefabricated adhesive labels or give-away products (such as small gummy bear bags) can be purchased to be resold, which then serve as carriers of a QR code for the digital receipt. There are no delays due to the interaction of the cash register or the operating personnel with the consumer, because the consumer receives a give-away and can retrieve the digital receipt later, regardless of time and location.

The cashier can flexibly scan the QR code on the give-away during the production process or during the payment process and thus establish the connection to the receipt created. If the consumer is interested in the receipt and scans it with their own smartphone after the purchase, they are taken to a web-based view of the receipt without having to install a separate app. In this view, the consumer can also provide feedback on the purchased goods or on the operating personnel at the moment of purchase. This feedback can be evaluated by the PosOperator, the seller of the service, and can easily be put in context with the time of service and the items sold.

The operator's PosDealer can participate by means of placing orders and intermediary in support and billing for each transaction of the POS operator. This applies to every single receipt issued, as the giveaway is issued regardless of how it is viewed and used by the consumer. Since the cost of a QR code label for the digital receipt is less than one third of an 80/80/12 thermal roll at an average length of 20cm per receipt, the margin to be achieved for the PosDealer is higher than for thermal paper (if the PosDealer does not want to contribute an additional investment for giveaways in consumer satisfaction).

### Process flow
- The POS system scans the giveaway QR code and saves it.
- The POS system prepares the data for the receipt request to the `/Sign` method of the fiskaltrust.Middleware, and fills **one** of the following data fields with the scanned QR code data in JSON format (see below):
  - In the `ftReceiptCaseData` property of the receipt request
  - As an item within a `ChargeItem`, using the using the `ftChargeItemCaseData` field.
  - As an item within a `PayItem`, using the using the `ftPayItemCaseData` field.
- The POS software calls the Middleware's `/Sign` function with the computed receipt request, and the request is processed by the Middleware.
- The customer or consumer receives the give-away with the previously scanned QR code, and can then display the digital receipt at any time by scanning it.

### Request details
The scanned link from the QR code must be sent to the Middleware in the following JSON format (in one of the fields described above):
```jsonc
"ftReceiptCaseData":  "{ \"ReceiptTag\": \"https://receipts.fiskaltrust.cloud?tag=abc123456789\" }"

// Or:
"ftChargeItemCaseData": "{ \"ReceiptTag\": \"https://receipts.fiskaltrust.cloud?tag=abc123456789\" }"

// Or:
"ftPayItemCaseData": "{ \"ReceiptTag\": \"https://receipts.fiskaltrust.cloud?tag=abc123456789\" }"
```

A full example containing all three options could e.g. look like this:
```json
{
    "ftCashBoxID": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",

:::caution

Please keep in mind that in a real use case, only **one** of the three mentioned ways to inject the link into the receipt request should be used, depending on what fits the POS software's internal flows best.
