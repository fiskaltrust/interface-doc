# Getting started

In this section, the implementation steps to achieve and ensure a complete integration into your Point of Sale software are described. 

Please note, that currently the digital receipt can only be implemented into existing middleware integrations. An own standalone digital receipt API is not available yet. 

This high level overview shows you the implementation and configuration steps, who are required for the digital receipt and the InStore App.
