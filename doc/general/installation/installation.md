#### Test Environment

In Windows, it is necessary to run the `cmd.exe` as administrator. The launcher `fiskaltrust.exe` can be then executed as a command line program through the call parameter `–test`.

In Linux, the following command should be used:

```sudo mono fiskaltrust.exe -test```.

A static configuration can be enforced via the configuration.json file in the `fiskaltrust.exe` folder in connection with `-useoffline=true`.

In Windows, all data is saved per default in `C:\ProgramData\fiskaltrust\service`. In Linux, the data is saved under `/usr/share/fiskaltrust/service`. The deletion of this folder results in a loss of data, and a loss in functionality of the fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism. In case of an active online connection, the fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism can restore its functionality without this folder, however the data which was lost cannot be restored.

#### Windows Service

The Windows service can be installed and uninstalled via the call parameters -i and –u.

Once successfully completed, the service will appear in the list of running services.

#### Mono Service

For Linux, the fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism can be installed as Daemon.

Mono is the prerequisite, and can be installed following the manual of the [mono-project](http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-lin) (install complete).

Once the installation is completed, a file named `fiskaltrust` with the following content has to be saved in the index `/etc/init.d`:

```sh
#! /bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:     fiskaltrust

# Required-Stop:   $local_fs $network

<span id="_Toc527986837" class="anchor"></span>*Code 13. Initializing the mono service*

Next, the folders have to be created and assigned the required permissions. In order to do that, the following commands have to be executed via the SSH-console:

> `sudo mkdir /etc/fiskaltrust`

> `sudo chmod 777 /etc/fiskaltrust`

Once the folders are set, the `fiskaltrust.exe` and the associated DLLs must be copied into the index "/etc/fiskaltrust", and the rights to execute the file have to be set as follows:

> `sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/fiskaltrust`

> `sudo chmod +x /etc/fiskaltrust/fiskaltrust.exe`

Finally, the daemon can be installed with the following command:

> `sudo update-rc.d fiskaltrust defaults`

Once completed, the service should appear in the running daemon list.

#### iOS-Devices, Android-Devices, Windows Universal App (XBox, Windows Phone, …)

A background app for each respective platform is in planning.

The scope of operation will be limited to one queue and the update ability will be realised via the platform store. The support nutshell will not be available.

The main features of the data and function structure however, will be the same, and the communication will be adapted to the platform specific standard.
