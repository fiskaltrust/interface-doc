## Function structures

More detailed descriptions of the function structures covered in Chapter ["Function structures"](../../general/function-structures/function-structures.md) of the General Part, with country-specific information applicable to the Austrian market.

### iPOS Interface

#### Echo Function

In case of the Austrian product SignaturCloud, there is a special condition when the Echo-Function is called with null as a Message, which forces to reinitialize the fiskaltrust.Queue in the fiskaltrust.Middleware.

#### Sign Function

The sign function meets the RKSV requirements when the fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism is run in the following mode: the country set for creating the queue is AT, and the cbReceiptCase has the flag `0x4154000000000000`.

#### Journal Function

A list with possible values for the request parameter ftJournalType for the Austrian market is provided in the reference table ["Type of Journal: ftJournalType (AT - RKSVO)"](../reference-tables/reference-tables.md#t-type-of-journal-ftjournaltype-190).

### RKSV-DEP Export

This interface allows requesting the RKSV-DEP by means of ftJournalType `0x4154â€¦01`. It is required to retrieve data at the cash register in case of a check or an inspection (for example through fiscal authorities).

In addition, a security file of the RKSV-DEP is generated with each monthly report. The file name of this backup file can also be retrieved. The name of the file is composed as follows:

`QueueID + CurrentDateTime + CashBoxId + LastSettlementMonth + "\_rksv\_dep.json"`

The CurrentDateTime is provided in the `yyyyMMddhhmmssfff` format.

### IATSSCD Interface

This interface is applicable only for the Austrian market and enables direct communication with the signature creation device for own purposes: it can be used for testing if the fiskaltrust.Middleware is running ("Echo" call), for requesting the certificate ("Certificate" call), or for signing autonomously ("Sign" call).

#### ZDA Indicator Request

The ZDA indicator can be requested with the function:

`string ZDA();`

#### Certificate Request

The signature certificate can be requested with the public key of the signature creation device with the function:

`byte[] Certificate();`

#### Signature Function

The data can be signed with the function:

`byte[] Sign(byte[] data);`
