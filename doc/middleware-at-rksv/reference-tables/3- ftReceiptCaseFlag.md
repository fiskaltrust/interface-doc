| `0x0000000000010000` | "out of service"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which has been created during an outage of the security mechanism. The original receipts are available in handwritten or digital format and must now be transferred and subsequently consolidated and signed via zero receipt. In order to decide whether it is a temporary or permanent (more than 48 hours) outage of the security mechanism (for example in case of theft), the "oldest" or the receipt with the earliest date/time value of all retrieved receipts is used. This can be necessary, for example, after a power or server outage.                                                                   | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000020000` | "training receipt"<br />Requests with this type of receipt are annotated with the reference "TRA" in the signature block. Instead of the encrypted cumulative sales counter, the BASE64 encrypted value of the TRA string is entered. The sales counter is, in accordance with the RKSV, not adjusted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000040000` | "reverse receipt"<br />Requests with this type of receipt are annotated with the reference "STO" in the signature block. Instead of the encrypted cumulative sales counter, a BASE64 encrypted value of the STO string is entered. Further processing depends on the underlying type of receipt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000080000` | "handwritten receipt" or "subsequent entry"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which has been collected in a handwritten receipt. Although there is no requirement for a time annotation on a handwritten receipt we recommend using 12:00 for this purpose.<br />Further processing depends on the underlying type of receipt. For example, this can be conducted after §7 cash revenue law for sales made outside business premises.                                                                                                                         | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000100000` | "small business, sales tax relief in accordance with §6 Abs 1 Z 27 UStG (sales tax law)"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which have been generated by a small business. A special note "sales tax relief in accordance with §6 Abs 1 Z 27" is possible. The RKSV requirement is handled according to the basic business transaction.<br />The transferred receipt data should contain the correct VAT rate and the correct ftChargeItemCase, even if the identified sales tax is 0%.                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000200000` | "receiver is a company"<br />The transferred receipt contains a sales receipt, and the receiver is a trader.<br />Note regarding the characteristics of §11 UStG: for receipts with up to €400 gross amount, an invoice for small amounts can be issued. From €400 onwards, there are additional features to be displayed on the invoice, to enable the pre-tax deduction for the receiver of the invoice.<br />For receipts with a gross amount of €10.000 or more, in addition, the service receiver’s UID number has to be indicated.<br />We suggest transferring the data about the receiver in the field ftReceiptCaseData, in manufacturer-specific JSON format. | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000400000` | "contains characteristics in accordance with §11 UStG"<br />On the receipt, the characteristics are issued in accordance with §11 UStG, and the transferred receipt contains receiver data in manufacturer-specific JSON format within the field ftReceiptCaseData.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 1.0           |
| `0x0000800000000000` | Receipt request. Common behaviour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                 |
