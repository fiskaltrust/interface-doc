## Reference tables

This chapter expands on the reference tables covered in the Chapter ["Reference tables"](../../general/reference-tables/reference-tables.md) of the General Part, with country-specific information applicable to the Austrian market.

### Service Status: ftState

The table below describes it supported statuses for the ftState field following the Austrian law. The ftState from this reference table and the general part of this documentation can be combined through the logic operator "OR". For example `0x4154000000000010` (monthly report due) and `0x4154000000000008` combined through `OR` results in `0x4154000000000018`.

The country-specific code is made of the country's code value following the ISO-3166-1-ALPHA-2 standard, converted from ASCII into hex. For Austria (AT) this is `0x4154`, which results in `0x4154000000000000` as the value for the "ready" status.

| `0x4154000000000001` | "out of service"<br />No RKSV signatures are generated or sent back. No RKSV-DEP is written, as nothing is being signed. The E131-DEP records requests and responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000002` | "SSCD temporary out of service"<br />For at least one receipt, it was not possible to receive the signature from an allocated SSCD. Thus, the security mechanism has been put into "signature creation device out of service" mode. Regardless of whether an allocated SSCD is available again or not, the mode remains in place until, via zero receipt, all previous receipts can be signed. If this mode is activated, an out of service signature, in accordance with the RKSV, is generated and sent back. | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000004` | "SSCD permanently out of service"<br />The status "SSCD temporary out of service" was activated more than 48h ago. Thus a FinanzOnline notification has been generated.<br />For conduct and termination of this mode, see "SSCD temporary out of service".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000008` | "subsequent entry activated"<br />At least one receipt has been transferred with a subsequent entry flag. In order to finalize the subsequent entry and leave the mode, it is necessary to generate a zero receipt. This zero receipt signs and secures the preliminary receipts accordingly to the RKSV.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000010` | "monthly report due"<br />If the latest monthly or annual report are is in the current month, the service will signal this. This status does not impact the signature conduct of the service; it is merely an indicative notification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000020` | "annual report due"<br />Same conduct as for "monthly report due"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 1.0                 |

| `0x0000000000010000` | "out of service"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which has been created during an outage of the security mechanism. The original receipts are available in handwritten or digital format and must now be transferred and subsequently consolidated and signed via zero receipt. In order to decide whether it is a temporary or permanent (more than 48 hours) outage of the security mechanism (for example in case of theft), the "oldest" or the receipt with the earliest date/time value of all retrieved receipts is used. This can be necessary, for example, after a power or server outage.                                                                   | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000020000` | "training receipt"<br />Requests with this type of receipt are annotated with the reference "TRA" in the signature block. Instead of the encrypted cumulative sales counter, the BASE64 encrypted value of the TRA string is entered. The sales counter is, in accordance with the RKSV, not adjusted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000040000` | "reverse receipt"<br />Requests with this type of receipt are annotated with the reference "STO" in the signature block. Instead of the encrypted cumulative sales counter, a BASE64 encrypted value of the STO string is entered. Further processing depends on the underlying type of receipt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000080000` | "handwritten receipt" or "subsequent entry"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which has been collected in a handwritten receipt. Although there is no requirement for a time annotation on a handwritten receipt we recommend using 12:00 for this purpose.<br />Further processing depends on the underlying type of receipt. For example, this can be conducted after §7 cash revenue law for sales made outside business premises.                                                                                                                         | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000100000` | "small business, sales tax relief in accordance with §6 Abs 1 Z 27 UStG (sales tax law)"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which have been generated by a small business. A special note "sales tax relief in accordance with §6 Abs 1 Z 27" is possible. The RKSV requirement is handled according to the basic business transaction.<br />The transferred receipt data should contain the correct VAT rate and the correct ftChargeItemCase, even if the identified sales tax is 0%.                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000200000` | "receiver is a company"<br />The transferred receipt contains a sales receipt, and the receiver is a trader.<br />Note regarding the characteristics of §11 UStG: for receipts with up to €400 gross amount, an invoice for small amounts can be issued. From €400 onwards, there are additional features to be displayed on the invoice, to enable the pre-tax deduction for the receiver of the invoice.<br />For receipts with a gross amount of €10.000 or more, in addition, the service receiver’s UID number has to be indicated.<br />We suggest transferring the data about the receiver in the field ftReceiptCaseData, in manufacturer-specific JSON format. | 1.0           |

This table expands on the values provided in the table ["Format of Signature: ftSignatureFormat"](../../general/reference-tables/reference-tables.md#t-type-of-signature-ftsignatureformat-112) with values applicable to the Austrian market.

According to the RKSV, there is one exception: if the fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism responds with a QR code but the printer, through which the receipt is supposed to be printed (or electronically issued), cannot display QR codes, it is allowed to convert the signature value and display it as bar code, link, or in OCR typeface on the receipt. This requirement and a sample code can be found in the Chapter ["Printing of QR-Code not supported"](#printing-of-qr-code-not-supported).

### <span id="c-printing-of-qr-code-not-supported-191">Printing of QR-Code not supported</span>

If no QR code can be issued, it is allowed to place text using OCR typeface onto the receipt. For this procedure, BASE64-coded data fields are displayed in BASE32 according to §11 para. 2 RKSV. This is because the capital "i" and lowercase "L" are not distinguishable from each other in many typefaces.

For example, the following signature value is converted in the way described above. Whereby the following output BASE64 (bold) is:

```nohighlight
_R1-AT0_DEMO-CASH-BOX426_776730_2015-10-14T18:20:23_0,00_0,00_0,00_0,00_0,00_0gJTFI8/zqc=_968935007593160625_fP7/PMP-SnQ0=_Xh5wNe0akaTOVvMgLVrCcRh2xmIyP91ogbxc5xv4Rrw64lpQsqLm+1GZxuCz4D1sZl9WCv3wMMoE0p+gyLaufg==
```

<span id="_Toc527986839" class="anchor"></span>

*Code 15. Example of OCR output in Base64*

The BASE32 display in accordance with the RKSV for this OCR text output in BASE32 (bold) looks as follows:

```nohighlight
_R1-AT0_DEMO-CASH-BOX426_776730_2015-10-14T18:20:23_0,00_0,00_0,00_0,00_0,00_2IBFGFEPH7HKO===_968935007593160625_PT7P6PGD2KOQ2===_LYPHANPNDKI2JTSW6MQC2WWCOEMHNRTCGI7522EBXROOOG7YI26DVYS2KCZKFZX3KGM4NYFT4A6WYZS7KYFP34BQZICNFH5AZC3K47Q=
```

<span id="_Toc527986840" class="anchor"></span>

*Code 16. Example of OCR output in Base32*

This procedure has to be carried out by the cash register or input station itself because the service does not know whether a QR code can be printed or not, and because the data format for DEP storage requires a BASE64 display anyway.

A conversion tool is provided in the class fiskaltrust.ifPOS.Utility.
