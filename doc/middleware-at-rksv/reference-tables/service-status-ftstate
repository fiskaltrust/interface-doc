## Reference tables

This chapter expands on the reference tables covered in the Chapter ["Reference tables"](../../general/reference-tables/reference-tables.md) of the General Part, with country-specific information applicable to the Austrian market.

### Service Status: ftState

The table below describes it supported statuses for the ftState field following the Austrian law. The ftState from this reference table and the general part of this documentation can be combined through the logic operator "OR". For example `0x4154000000000010` (monthly report due) and `0x4154000000000008` combined through `OR` results in `0x4154000000000018`.

The country-specific code is made of the country's code value following the ISO-3166-1-ALPHA-2 standard, converted from ASCII into hex. For Austria (AT) this is `0x4154`, which results in `0x4154000000000000` as the value for the "ready" status.

|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `0x4154000000000001` | "out of service"<br />No RKSV signatures are generated or sent back. No RKSV-DEP is written, as nothing is being signed. The E131-DEP records requests and responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000002` | "SSCD temporary out of service"<br />For at least one receipt, it was not possible to receive the signature from an allocated SSCD. Thus, the security mechanism has been put into "signature creation device out of service" mode. Regardless of whether an allocated SSCD is available again or not, the mode remains in place until, via zero receipt, all previous receipts can be signed. If this mode is activated, an out of service signature, in accordance with the RKSV, is generated and sent back. | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000004` | "SSCD permanently out of service"<br />The status "SSCD temporary out of service" was activated more than 48h ago. Thus a FinanzOnline notification has been generated.<br />For conduct and termination of this mode, see "SSCD temporary out of service".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000008` | "subsequent entry activated"<br />At least one receipt has been transferred with a subsequent entry flag. In order to finalize the subsequent entry and leave the mode, it is necessary to generate a zero receipt. This zero receipt signs and secures the preliminary receipts accordingly to the RKSV.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000010` | "monthly report due"<br />If the latest monthly or annual report are is in the current month, the service will signal this. This status does not impact the signature conduct of the service; it is merely an indicative notification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000020` | "annual report due"<br />Same conduct as for "monthly report due"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000040` | "message / notification pending"<br />A status message and/or FinanzOnline notification is ready for collection.<br />Using a zero receipt, the messages can be retrieved and archived or processed in bookkeeping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 1.0                 |
| `0x4154000000000080` | "backup SSCD in use"<br />The receipt was signed by a signature creation unit configured for backup use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 1.1.17248           |
