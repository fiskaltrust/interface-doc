### Type of Receipt: ftReceiptCase

The ftReceiptCase indicates the receipt type and defines how it should be processed by the fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism in accordance with the Austrian law.

For Austria (AT) the country code is `0x4154`. Thus, the value for an unknown ftReceiptCase in Austria is `0x4154000000000000`.

| `0x415400000000000A` | "cash deposit"<br />For example the payment of a target calculation, or deposit on the customer card.<br />Usually, the receipt data only includes pay items while the charge items block remains empty. Since the total amount must always be zero, you must use a negative pay item to balance the sum of pay items to zero.                                                           | 1.0                |

| `0x415400000000000D` | "protocol"<br />Simple protocol function. The data sets that need to be logged can be transferred in the field ftReceiptCaseData in manufacturer-specific JSON format. For example, opening the cash drawer or changing master data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1.0                |

| `0x0000000000010000` | "out of service"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which has been created during an outage of the security mechanism. The original receipts are available in handwritten or digital format and must now be transferred and subsequently consolidated and signed via zero receipt. In order to decide whether it is a temporary or permanent (more than 48 hours) outage of the security mechanism (for example in case of theft), the "oldest" or the receipt with the earliest date/time value of all retrieved receipts is used. This can be necessary, for example, after a power or server outage.                                                                   | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000020000` | "training receipt"<br />Requests with this type of receipt are annotated with the reference "TRA" in the signature block. Instead of the encrypted cumulative sales counter, the BASE64 encrypted value of the TRA string is entered. The sales counter is, in accordance with the RKSV, not adjusted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000040000` | "reverse receipt"<br />Requests with this type of receipt are annotated with the reference "STO" in the signature block. Instead of the encrypted cumulative sales counter, a BASE64 encrypted value of the STO string is entered. Further processing depends on the underlying type of receipt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000080000` | "handwritten receipt" or "subsequent entry"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which has been collected in a handwritten receipt. Although there is no requirement for a time annotation on a handwritten receipt we recommend using 12:00 for this purpose.<br />Further processing depends on the underlying type of receipt. For example, this can be conducted after §7 cash revenue law for sales made outside business premises.                                                                                                                         | 1.0           |
| `0x0000000000100000` | "small business, sales tax relief in accordance with §6 Abs 1 Z 27 UStG (sales tax law)"<br />The transferred receipt contains data which have been generated by a small business. A special note "sales tax relief in accordance with §6 Abs 1 Z 27" is possible. The RKSV requirement is handled according to the basic business transaction.<br />The transferred receipt data should contain the correct VAT rate and the correct ftChargeItemCase, even if the identified sales tax is 0%.                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1.0           |
