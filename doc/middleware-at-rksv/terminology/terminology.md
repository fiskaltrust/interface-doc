| Cash register (RegK)                    | A cash register system (as well as classic cash register) combined with a fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism is a POS-System in terms of RKSV. It may be associated with an additional input station. For simplicity purposes in the following text, we do not distinguish between the cash register itself and input stations - this difference is important only for calculating the state grant for each cash register.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
