# fiskaltrust.Middleware f√ºr Windows

The fiskaltrust.Middleware runs as a service on all 32-bit and 64-bit platforms starting from Windows 7. Older operating systems are not supported as they do not meet the legal requirements of a "safe system environment".

## Windows versions/.NET Framework support and prerequisites

All supported operating system need C++ Runtime in 32 or 64 bit installed. 

**We recommend to use .NET Framework 4.8 if possible.**

Please be aware that dependent on the TSE used there may be additional requirements on protecting the OS environment as documented in the [on-premise-installation overview](../on-premise-installation.md).
