# Type of Signature: ftSignatureType

The `ftSignatureType` indicates the type and origin of the signature. The data type is `Int64` and can contain a country-specific code, a value following the ISO-3166-1-ALPHA-2 standard, converted from ASCII into hex and used as byte 8 and 7.

:::tip

The German Middleware returns multiple additional signature items that are later used while generating our DSFinV-K export and **do not need to be printed**. To identify those, we have added a flag to the `ftSignatureFormat`, which is described [here](type-of-signature-ftsignatureformat.md)
