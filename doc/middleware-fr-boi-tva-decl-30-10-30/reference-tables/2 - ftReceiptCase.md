## Type of Receipt: ftReceiptCase

The `ftReceiptCase` defines the type of receipt and hence how fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanisms should process receipts according to French law.

The country-specific code is made of the country's code value following the ISO-3166-1-ALPHA-2 standard, converted from ASCII into hex. For France (FR), the country code is `0x4652`. Thus, the value for an unknown `ftReceiptCase` in France is `0x4652000000000000`.
