# Reference tables

### Service Status: ftState

The ftState is returned with every receipt response. Through this status, fiskaltrust.Middleware can signal its operability or request processing logic.

The country-specific code is made of the country's code value following the ISO-3166-1-ALPHA-2 standard, converted from ASCII into hex. For France (FR), the country code is `0x4652`, which results in `0x4652000000000000` as the value for the "ready" status.

The table below describes supported statuses for the ftState field. Those codes can be combined by using the logic operator `OR`<span id="t-service-status-ftstate-22">.</span>

## Type of Receipt: ftReceiptCase

The `ftReceiptCase` defines the type of receipt and hence how fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanisms should process receipts according to French law.

The country-specific code is made of the country's code value following the ISO-3166-1-ALPHA-2 standard, converted from ASCII into hex. For France (FR), the country code is `0x4652`. Thus, the value for an unknown `ftReceiptCase` in France is `0x4652000000000000`.

The `ftChargeItemCase` defines the type of service in charge item blocks and how fiskaltrust.SecurityMechanism processes individual receipts following French law.

For France (FR), the country code is 0x4652. Thus, the value for an unknown `ftChargeItemCase` in France is `0x4652000000000000`.
