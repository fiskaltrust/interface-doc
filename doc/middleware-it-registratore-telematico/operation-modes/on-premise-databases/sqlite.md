# SQLite Storage

## Support

**from version:** 1.3.45

The use of the SQLite storage provider enables the middleware to be operated with a local, file-based database. The middleware stores all data processed during operation of the queue as well as all configuration data directly in the database.

This storage provider is particularly suitable for the simple construction of smaller, locally operated cash register systems.

## Parameters
TBD
